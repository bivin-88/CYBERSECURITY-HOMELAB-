# CYBERSECURITY-HOMELAB-
In the rapidly evolving landscape of cybersecurity, hands-on experience is crucial for
understanding and mitigating security threats. This project involves setting up a fully functional
cybersecurity homelab to simulate real-world security scenarios and conduct offensive and
defensive security operations. The lab environment includes multiple machines configured for
both attack and defense, making it an ideal platform for learning and testing cybersecurity
techniques, tools, and methodologies.
The homelab setup comprises an attacker machine (Kali Linux), multiple target machines with
known vulnerabilities (Metasploitable2, Ubuntu with DVWA, and a vulnerable Windows
machine), a Security Operations Center (SOC) machine, an OpenVPN server for secure
connectivity, and a pfSense firewall for network security. Through this project, various attack
simulations such as web application exploitation, phishing campaigns, and Golden Ticket
attacks were conducted including carrying out vulnerability scanning on metasploitable2
machine, exploited each of the vulnerabilities and gained access to the target from the attacker
machine and carried out post exploitation methods as well. I concluded with the implementation
of defensive measures like firewalls and secure network access.

*Project Objectives*
1. Practical Learning: Gain hands-on experience in offensive and defensive security
operations.
2. Attack Simulations: Perform web application attacks, phishing campaigns, and
Windows exploitation techniques.
3. Vulnerability Analysis: Identify, exploit, and analyze vulnerabilities in target machines.
4. Network Security: Implement secure network configurations using OpenVPN and
pfSense firewall.
5. Security Monitoring: Set up and configure a Security Operations Center (SOC) for
monitoring threats and analyzing logs.
6. Documentation & Reporting: Maintain comprehensive documentation for each attack
simulation and mitigation strategy.
